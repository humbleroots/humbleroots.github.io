# Humble Roots

Humble Roots is a proposed online marketplace that connects local farmers and consumers looking for fresh, locally sourced produce at great prices.

## Noticeable Changes

The home page search bar has been broken up into two parts, where the user is able to search for the produce, and enter their location.


The tiles of the individual items were changed in a somewhat significant way. The small black text box is no longer translucent, and also includes small colorful tags that help quickly describe some of the more defining qualities of the produce.

The Add to basket icon was changed from green to red, as some research papers suggested that using red when purchasing food actually made people hungrier and thus more likely to follow through with a food order.

On the delivery page, when the user selects the Home Delivery radio button, a form appears and goes away when the user clicks the other radio option.



### Problems I Encountered or Could Not Resolve

The biggest is clearly getting the site to be responsive. My original vision was to get the tiles to width 100% if the user was viewing it from a phone, but some of the icons were difficult to arrange, so responsiveness was scrapped entirely.

There was also an issue in getting a youtube video to act responsively as well. Originally a 416px high banner video, the video idea was scrapped because the aspect ratio was too wide, meaning black bars would start too appear since the container would be larger than the tinier video as the user shrank the browser window. 

I wasn’t sure how to get a carousel to work on my item.html file. I didn’t really want to use bootstrap, and even if I wanted to, some of the css styles were conflicting with mine, so this function was omitted. The carousel for the “Other Customers Bought this” was also omitted from this final version.

In the basket, the small plus and minus buttons were removed because there was a HTML number tag was was much easier to implement and could carry out the same function.

For the delivery options page, I tried using the Google Maps API, to limited success. While I was able to get some markers on specific locations around Rhode Island, time constraints and just my inability to work with the API, kept me from adding text and poppets that would tell users more about the available drop off locations.

Other general features I was unable to implement were the small question mark popups featured in the “results” and “payment” pages. These little popups would have provided the user with hints and would have helped explain what certain terms meant (i.e CVV and Truly Local.)

One final issue I faced was that my site would often run into problems with source.unsplash.com, meaning certain images may not load entirely, which could be problematic when the time comes to review my assignment.
